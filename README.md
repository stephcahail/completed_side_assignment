# Code and Design Decisions

I have completed the exercise with the assumption that none of the property values will be null.

I chose to test the application with unit tests because it's the best strategy for isolating elements to make sure each one renders properly.

A few items left out due to time constraints:
1. Making the states in addresses abbreviated
2. Formatting the dates so single-digit month and days don't have the extra 0 (ex: 01/30 vs 1/30)

2/2 Updates:
TODO:
1. Update tests for the components
2. Perhaps condense FavoritesPage and PropertyListingPage into one component since they're very similar
